    <h1>The Shawshank Redemption — Review</h1>

    <h2>1. Your favourite dialogue and why?</h2>
    <p><b>"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."</b> — This line resonates deeply because it captures the core of human resilience. No matter how dark life feels, holding onto hope keeps us alive inside.</p>

    <h2>2. Your personal review</h2>
    <p>The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that lingers in your mind for days. It’s more than a story about escaping prison — it’s a story about hope, friendship, and endurance. The performances, especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, are natural and heart-touching. Every scene builds toward an ending that feels incredibly rewarding.</p>

    <h2>3. Learning to take away from the movie</h2>
    <p>Never lose hope, no matter how long the struggle or how hard the circumstances. The movie teaches that persistence and inner strength can help us overcome even the most suffocating environments.</p>

    <h2>4. Related concepts you've learned in the classroom</h2>
    <p>In my communication skills classes, we often discuss resilience, motivation, and long-term goal setting — all of which are embodied in Andy Dufresne’s journey in the movie. It reminded me of how mindset plays a crucial role in professional and personal growth.</p>
